### Hi!! 👋 Meta-Digital-Human-Nature Morld!!! 🌍❤

I´m a Digital Artist and Coder. I love any type of human-animal interaction with machines, and yes, that is good. One of my essential sayings is:

  Everything you see can be transformed into art, magic and interaction.

I am currently learning coding at 42 madrid (yes, it is exciting)
